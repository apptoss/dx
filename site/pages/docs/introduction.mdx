# Bearium Protocol in 5 Minutes

## Overview

This marketplace is more than a frontendâ€”it runs on **Bearium**, a settlement protocol for onchain casinos.

Bearium introduces a mental model ðŸ§  built on:

- **Peers**, risk-absorbing actors that issue credits
    
- **Credits**, tokenized potential for trustless, time-flexible payouts
    
- **Clearinghouse**, a programmable OpEx engine for skins, referrals, and campaigns
    

Every transaction hereâ€”every fee, royalty, or rewardâ€”is powered by Beariumâ€™s core logic.  
**No house. No middlemen. Just credits, coordination, and code.**

## Peers: Risk-Absorbing Actors

- A _Peer_ is an autonomous object account that absorbs real assets and issues its own **Alpha Credits**.
    
- Peers act like **risk capacitors**, enabling P2P coordination without middlemen.
    
- LLN (Law of Large Numbers) makes this design viable: aggregate outcomes stabilize risk.
    

## Credit-Centric Design

- The system runs on **credits**â€”tokenized rewards that can be redeemed or traded.
    
- **All costs and payouts are in credits**: rewards, fees, commissions.
    
- Credit decouples capital _timing_ from capital _truth_.
    

## Games Define Risk Appetite

- Games plug into Peers and define risk-return models via multipliers.
    
- A 2Ã— coin flip? A 100Ã— crash game? All _use the same Peer_.
    
- Risk fees are baked in.
    

## Clearinghouse: The OpEx Engine

- A singleton **Clearinghouse** contract routes payouts through customizable hooks.
    
- **Agencies** are campaigns registered via hooks: skins, referrals, portals, etc.
    
- All hooks receive payouts in creditsâ€”programmable, traceable, fair.
