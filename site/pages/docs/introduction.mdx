## The Casino on Mars

It's useful to think of crypto as a new planet that's being settled.

Skeptics see a desolate planet without purpose. Or worse, a haven for an unsavory casino.

Optimists see the planet's potential: a blank slate on which we can build an upgraded financial system and internet platform.

appToss is an infrastructure/liquidity layer for on-chain casinos. It utilizes a new Liquidity Pool design, the Friend Registry, which creates and maintains market liquidity.

appToss supports thousands of slots & casino games, plus a rich feature set, which can be utilized by anyone permissionlessly for the creation of various apps, embedded integrations or derivative products.

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "appToss", some of which may confuse new users.

- **The appToss Protocol**: A suite of upgradable smart contracts that together create a protocol which can be used permissionlessly for the creation of houses of pools & iGaming products with Fungible Assets and Coins as well as Digital Assets on the Aptos blockchain.
- **The appToss Components**: Web components that make it quick & easy to build applications on appToss Protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may build a dApp.
- **appToss DAO**: A governance system for governing the appToss Protocol. The system is expected to transition and be enabled by a dedicated token, once the token is launched.
